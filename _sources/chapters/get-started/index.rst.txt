    Welcome! Let’s Begin Writing an Example Application

This guide will walk you through creating a small example application using the ELCL Parser for reading the application configuration. To get started, ensure you have:

* Your favorite C++ development environment.
* A Git client of your choice.

We’ll demonstrate using command-line tools, but you’re encouraged to use whatever tools you prefer to achieve the same results.
